### **Project Overview**

This documentation outlines the structure and design principles for creating a cutting-edge portfolio website. The site will feature a clean, modern aesthetic with a dual-theme (dark and bright) toggle, captivating animations, and a professional layout. It is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring seamless deployment and accessibility.

### **1. Project Structure & Asset Organization**

A well-organized project is the foundation of a successful website. Below is the recommended file and folder structure:

```
/portfolio-website
|-- /assets
|   |-- /css
|   |   |-- style.css
|   |-- /js
|   |   |-- main.js
|   |-- /images
|   |   |-- profile-photo.png
|   |   |-- favicon.ico
|   |-- /documents
|       |-- Client_CV.pdf
|-- index.html
|-- about.html
|-- experience.html
|-- skills.html
|-- education.html
|-- research.html  // Optional: If applicable
|-- contact.html
```

**Asset Guidelines:**

* **CV:** Place the client's CV in PDF format within the `/assets/documents/` directory. Name it something professional and straightforward, such as `Client_Name_CV.pdf`.
* **Photo:** The primary profile photo should be a high-resolution PNG with a transparent background to achieve the "pop-out" effect. Place it in the `/assets/images/` directory. Additional images for projects or other sections can also be stored here.

### **2. Global Design & Theming**

The website will feature a sophisticated and consistent design language across all pages, with the ability to switch between a dark and a bright theme.

**Color Palette:**

* **Dark Theme (Default):**
    * Background: `#1a1a1a` (Very Dark Gray)
    * Primary Text: `#ffffff` (White)
    * Secondary Text: `#a0a0a0` (Light Gray)
    * Accent/Highlight Color: `#00bcd4` (Cyan) or another vibrant color of your choice.
* **Bright Theme:**
    * Background: `#ffffff` (White)
    * Primary Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)
    * Secondary Text: `#666666` (Medium Gray)
    * Accent/Highlight Color: `#007bff` (Blue) or another professional color.

**Typography:**

* **Headings:** A modern, sans-serif font like 'Poppins', 'Montserrat', or 'Lato'.
* **Body Text:** A clean and readable sans-serif font such as 'Open Sans' or 'Roboto'.

**Theme Toggle:**

* **Location:** Top-right corner of the menu bar.
* **Functionality:** A toggle switch or an icon (e.g., sun/moon) that, when clicked, will switch the theme. The user's preference should be saved in `localStorage` so that the chosen theme persists across sessions.
* **Implementation:** Use a JavaScript function to add/remove a `dark-theme` class to the `<body>` element. The CSS will then apply the corresponding color schemes.

**Responsiveness:**

All text, images, and animations must be fully responsive. Text colors should automatically adjust for readability when the theme is switched. For instance, in the dark theme, the text will be light, and in the bright theme, it will be dark. This will be managed through the CSS variables tied to the theme class.

### **3. Website Pages**

The website will consist of several key pages to create a comprehensive professional portfolio.

#### **3.1. Menu Bar**

* **Style:** The menu bar will be transparent and fixed at the top of the page. On scroll, it can adopt a subtle background color to maintain readability.
* **Navigation Links:** Home, About, Experience, Skills, Education, Contact. If the client has research experience, a "Research & Publications" link should be included.
* **Active Page Indicator:** The link corresponding to the current page should be highlighted.

#### **3.2. Home Page (`index.html`)**

The home page is the centerpiece of the portfolio, designed to capture attention and provide a comprehensive overview of the client.

**Hero Section:**

* **Layout:** A two-column layout.
* **Left Column:**
    * **Name:** The client's full name in a large, bold heading.
    * **Description:** A concise and impactful professional summary. This should be a few sentences that encapsulate their expertise and career goals.
    * **Buttons:**
        * **CV Download:** A prominent button styled with the accent color. On click, it will open or download the CV from the `/assets/documents/` folder.
        * **About Me:** A secondary button that smoothly scrolls the user down to the "About" section on the home page.
* **Right Column:**
    * **Image:** The client's profile photo. To create the "pop-out" effect, the image should have a transparent background and be layered on top of animated background shapes or subtle particle animations.
    * **Background Animation:** Consider using a library like `particles.js` or creating custom CSS animations with geometric shapes that slowly move and fade in the background behind the image. The animation colors should adapt to the current theme.
* **Hero Section Animation:** The entire hero section can have a subtle fade-in and slide-up animation on page load to create a dynamic entrance.

**Other Sections on the Home Page:**

The home page will also feature condensed versions of the other main pages to provide a quick overview for visitors who prefer to scroll.

* **Brief About Section:** A short paragraph summarizing the "About" page.
* **Key Skills Section:** A grid or list of the most important skills.
* **Recent Experience Snippet:** The most recent job title and company.
* **Education Highlights:** The highest degree obtained.
* **Contact Call-to-Action:** A prompt to visit the contact page.

#### **3.3. About Page (`about.html`)**

This page will provide a more in-depth look at the client's background, personality, and professional journey.

* **Content:**
    * A detailed professional biography.
    * A section on their work philosophy and what drives them.
    * A mention of their hobbies and interests to add a personal touch.
* **Layout:** A clean, single-column or two-column layout with ample white space to enhance readability.

#### **3.4. Experience Page (`experience.html`)**

This page will showcase the client's professional history in a clear, chronological format.

* **Layout:** A vertical timeline is a highly effective and visually appealing way to present work experience.
* **Content for Each Entry:**
    * Job Title
    * Company Name & Location
    * Dates of Employment
    * A bulleted list of key responsibilities and achievements. Use action verbs to make the descriptions more impactful.

#### **3.5. Skills Page (`skills.html`)**

This page will detail the client's technical and soft skills.

* **Layout:** Categorize skills for clarity (e.g., Programming Languages, Frameworks & Libraries, Tools, Soft Skills).
* **Visual Representation:** Consider using progress bars or skill-level indicators to provide a quick visual assessment of proficiency. However, ensure these are used judiciously to avoid a cluttered look.

#### **3.6. Education Page (`education.html`)**

This page will outline the client's academic background.

* **Layout:** A clean, chronological listing.
* **Content for Each Entry:**
    * Degree and Major
    * University Name & Location
    * Graduation Date
    * Relevant coursework, academic awards, or honors.

#### **3.7. Research & Publications Page (`research.html`) - Optional**

If the client is involved in academia, this page is crucial.

* **Layout:** Separate sections for research projects and publications.
* **Content:**
    * **Research:** A brief description of each research project, including the problem statement, methodology, and outcomes.
    * **Publications:** A list of publications in a standard citation format (e.g., APA, MLA). Include links to the publications if available.

#### **3.8. Contact Page (`contact.html`)**

This page will provide clear and accessible contact information.

* **Information to Include:**
    * Email Address (as a `mailto:` link).
    * LinkedIn Profile URL.
    * Other professional social media links such as GitHub, ResearchGate, or Google Scholar, accompanied by their respective icons.
    * Optional: A professional Twitter/X or Instagram handle if it's relevant to their field.
* **What to Exclude:** Do not include a phone number or a physical home address to protect the client's privacy. A general location (e.g., "San Francisco Bay Area, USA") is acceptable.
* **Contact Form:** As requested, no email-based contact form will be implemented.

### **4. Technical Implementation & Best Practices**

* **GitHub Pages:** The website must be a static site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). There should be no server-side code. The main entry point should be `index.html` in the root directory.
* **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to improve SEO and accessibility.
* **CSS:**
    * Use a preprocessor like SASS or LESS for more organized and maintainable styles.
    * Employ Flexbox and Grid for layout to ensure responsiveness.
    * Use media queries to create a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* **JavaScript:**
    * Keep the JavaScript clean and well-commented.
    * The primary use of JavaScript will be for the theme toggle, smooth scrolling for internal links, and any animations that are not handled by CSS.
* **Comments:** Add comments throughout the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to explain the purpose of different sections of code. This is crucial for future maintenance and for demonstrating professionalism. For example:
    ```html
    <section class="hero" id="home">
        </section>
    ```
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure the website is accessible to all users. This includes using proper `alt` text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast (especially with the theme switcher), and making the site navigable via keyboard.

### **5. Final Touches for a Modern & Professional Feel**

* **Favicon:** Create a simple and professional favicon for the website.
* **Animations & Transitions:** Use subtle animations and transitions for hover effects on buttons and links, as well as for scrolling into new sections. These small details significantly enhance the user experience.
* **Cleanliness:** Maintain ample white space and a consistent margin and padding strategy throughout the site. Avoid clutter at all costs.
* **Knowledgeable Tone:** The written content should be professional, concise, and free of grammatical errors. It should reflect the client's expertise and professionalism.
